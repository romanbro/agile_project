## Hints:
- You may wish to change the issue tags that are in GitHub to map to different activities that you are carrying out:
 - Code Review
 - Documentation
 - Daily Scrums
 - etc.
- Feel free to add in additional folders/documents that you feel will benefit your repository.
- Have a look at the gitHub documentation for advice on how to use more advanced features in GitHub to support your work
