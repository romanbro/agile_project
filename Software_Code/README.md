# Software Code

All software code should be put in this folder along with either:
- The binaries to run your completed application (if desktop based)
- A link to your application running on a server (if web based)



To be able to connect to the database you need to add the mariadb-java-client-2.5.3.jar file to the runpath library (pictured in Capture.png).
